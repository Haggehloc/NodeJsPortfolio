# NodeJs Server Example

This software is meant as a portfolio project for my nodeJs skills. 
This is taken from an older version of a project I did as a base. 
This will not and should not be used for commercial use. 

To use the server, make sure you have node and npm installed on 
your system and run the command "npm start" to start the server. 
The default port it runs on is 5000, this can be changed within the
code I will at a later date add a tool for easier modification for
this. 

To hit one of the endpoints first get the base url, then add "/api".
on top of that add the folder name then the path name. So if I 
wanted to  test the users endpoint I would hit the path 
"~/api/users/test".
